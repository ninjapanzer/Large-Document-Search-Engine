The experiment set to prove this theory is the LDX or Levitated Dipole Experiment, a joint project between MIT and Columbia University. The current mechanism used in testing fusion reaction is called a tokamak, within plasma is focused with a huge magnetic field to force the plasma together and to contain the energy. This differs in design from the LDX where the magnet resides within the plasma and instead of around it. Also instead of directly focusing the plasma it creates a type of turbulence that contrary to prediction does not cause the plasma in the test chamber to spread out. Instead it causes the atoms to became more concentrated. This is essential to permit the fusion of these atoms to occur. The LDX also only uses a single fuel source, a form of heavy hydrogen called deuterium, as opposed to the tokamaks which use a combination of duterium and tritium. While the process of the LDX uses a single fuel it is believed that fusion between duterium and tritium will prove easier to achieve but will likely produce a lower net production due to the extra energy required to focus the plasma into fusion. In the LDX energy is still required to power the magnetic field but it is less of a "brute force" attempt at controlling the density of the plasma. Thanks to the constructive turbulence that is experience in strong natural magnetic fields energy may be saved in the containment process. The LDX can achieve this effect while operating in two modes stationary or levitating. The optimal mode, proven by test runs, is in its levitating state due to the fact that the confinement of the plasma is directly effected by any object that is in the way of the magnetic field.
