Room Temperature Superconductivity: The Hole-ly Grail of Physics

    Superconductivity itself is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that occurs in certain materials where when cooled past a critical temperature exhibits zero resistance to electrical current. Room temperature superconductivity, sometimes called high temperature superconductivity are materials which exhibit the Meissner effect when cooled. This effect is the exclusion of a magnetic field when a material is transitioning to a superconductor. This is the cause for the levitation present in this picture.
    Room temperature superconductors were discovered in 1986 by a group of researchers at IBM, Karl Muller and Johannes Bednorz, It was this discovery that showed the commercial application of superconductivity. The goal being that products created with superconductors would be more efficient. In the course of electronics a material that could act as a superconductor at normal air temperature would require less power to operate as non would be lost during the transmission of that power. The same is true for electrical signals which could be sent as much lower current. We have not achieved this effect at room temperature yet but as we identify what allows some substance of varied makeup to become superconductive the focus has moved towards identifying material structure more then material makup.
    The trouble with superconductors is the varied materials and situations at which it occurs. Aside from the obvious discussion of transitional temperature there is also the question of structure both physically and chemically that play an effect. The orgional high temerpature superconductors where cuprates. But soon Iron and selenium were also combined with the same effect. On top of that there are certain non-superconducting materials that become superconducting when combined with other materials. Like in most things physics we are looking for a general rule or process to define what is and can be superconducting. This can make experimenting with the material a bit of a shot in the dark for the current time.
    When superconductivity occurs in traditional or highly doped unconventional superconductors holes form in the material that permit the transmission of electrons and sometimes magnetic fields through the material. This singular effect is also evident in new experiments using a complex layering of materials that by themselves are not superconducting. Thus the variance possibility for even more diverse and higher temperature materials is always a possibility. This new angle on superconductors has created a tug-of-war between structure and chemical make-up. The likely hood is that structure will prove to be the key element in creating the sought after room temperature superconductor.
   The focus on structure seems to be our biggest step towards success though. In the future the ability to also produce very thin materials could play an instrumental role in its discovery. Currently scientists at The Brookhaven National Laboratory have been using the same layering technique to create thin films of materials that can be controlled by an external electric field to achieve superconductivity. Also the thinner the material the less energy required to cool it while not effectively raising the critical temperature of the material this could make achieving these states less costly in an industrial setting.
    Even now room temperature superconductivity is a dream for physicists, although there have been many claimed successes of room temperature superconductivity all have been discovered false. It is still unknown if thickness, structure, or chemical makeup will prove the winner in the first verifiable room temperature superconductor. But, it seems without question that the reality that we will eventually achieve the effect is far from speculative.
