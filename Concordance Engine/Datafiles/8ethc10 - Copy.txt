High Temperature Superconductivity: Too Hot to Handle?

    Superconductivity was discovered in 1911 by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes and has been in ready use since the early 70s. Our understanding of the phenomena when certain materials achieve zero-resistance states at extremely low temperatures remains limited. As well as our understanding of the so called, "High Temperature Superconductivity", in which materials can be produced that act as superconductors at room temperatures. In reality, what is called high temperature is actually "High Critical Temperature" which describes the critical point at which superconductivity occurs. Room temperature does not seem to equate to high temperature for us, but when you live in the Kelvin scale and normally only experience superconductivity at 35K (-238C) and room temperature is ~300K it is a big jump.
    Much of the research in superconductivity and high temperature superconductivity is the development of materials to test the properties of superconductivity and to prove the relationships between different constructions that are superconductive. In terms of high temperature superconductivity there lacks a theory that joins superconductive materials produced with different materials. This is the goal of Francesc Illas of the UB's Institute of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry.
    His study is to prove that the families of Copper paired(cuprates) superconductors and the new Arsenic Ferric high critical temperature superconductors can be used to explain the over-arching properties of superconductors. This theory came from the hypothesis that both of these materials exhibit similar electronic structures and magnetic properties. Due to these magnetic properties, the interpretation of standard experiments developed to study cuprates are very difficult to collaborate. New testing techniques will have to be produced, for now the hybridization of Local Density Approximation and Generalized Gradient Approximation are the tools.
    These methods of categorizing the properties of superconductors have led to erroneous results. Since Arsenic Ferric superconductors show themselves to be highly metallic and cuprates show themselves to be insulating and anti-ferromagnetic. Thus, more sophisticated systems must be constructed to discover the underlying similarities, if there are any. To explore the construction and properties of the superconductors, we will need to be able to see items on the atomic level in a material. Specifically we need to be able to trace the path of an atom through the superconductor. A technique that allows us to see into the atomic structure of these materials would also shine light on many other aspects of atomic physics and chemistry.
    There is no question that superconductors have changed our lives even if we do not see them in our everyday world. Namely in medicine and transportation: Superconductors are well suited to create strong manageable magnetic fields. Without superconductors MRI scanning would be extremely difficult and the idea of the MAGLEV for transportation would be a fevered dream.
    The question comes to how would a room temperature superconductor effect your life. Lets first look at computers, while current commercial CPU technology is based upon semi-conductors the idea of using superconductors with an unconventional type of electron switch like the Josephson Junction could allow for major climbs in speed and significantly reduce energy consumption. The major feat of superconductors is their ability to move current at zero-resistance. The two factors at work with a semi-conductor CPU, is the power-draw and the heat generated by that current. Both of these effects are the result of the natural resistance of the semi-conductor. So, if we can remove all resistance, it would be feasible to effectivly crank the speed of conventional CPU's to amazing speeds with next to no cooling and almost no increase in  power consumption.
    The biggest boon to the average man thanks to high temperature superconductivity is the delivery of electricity. An electrical infrastructure that has zero-resistance would waste less energy in the transmission process, reducing the number of sub-stations needed to boost electricity, and almost completely eliminate the need for huge bundles of bulky wires for the transmission. Theoretically, a single 1/4 in flat cable could act as an electrical trunk.
    The final benefit would be near instantaneous communications. Right now, we struggle with the implementation of fiber-optic networks to reduce the transmission loss over distance. But at some point, on at least one end of a communication path an electronic signal has to be converted to an optical pulse. With zero-resistance superconductive communication lines we would be able to eliminate this modulation and create broadband trunks which would only be slowed by the volume of traffic transmitted upon them.
